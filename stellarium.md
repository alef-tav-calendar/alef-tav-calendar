## Stellarium configuration for Alef-Tav Calendar videos.

This is a list of the Stellarium Software settings that I used in the videos.

- Install Stellarium https://stellarium.org/
- Load in Aleph Bet constellation maps as a sky-culture.  Available to download on this github site..
- Replace the default milkyway.png with a higher resolution milkyway.png in order to see more details.  Available to download on this github site in stellarium/milkyway.png.
-- I also google image search for higher resolution photos and use them outside of Stellarium.
- View Options=>Sky tab: Reduce the brightness of the stars by adjusting the Absolute scale down between 0.6 and 0.4.  We only want to work with the brightest stars.
- View Options=>Sky tab: Later you may want to increase the Milky Way Brightness.
- View Options=>Markings: Useful markings are
-- Equinoxes (of date)
-- Solstices (of date)
-- Ecliptic (of date)
- View Options=>Starlore: As the edges of the letters overlap, it is useful to have two carts for even and odd letters.   It is helpful to have the Starlore dialogue off to the far right of the screen in order to toggle between charts.
Load in some landscapes from the area of mount Ararat.
- The view and angle of the stars changes with your location on earth.  I’ll use the following locations:
-- Jerusalem ( built in )
-- Egypt ( built in )
-- Yerevan, Western Asia ( built in ) - near mount Ararat.
-- Mt Sinai (added) N28 32’ 21.90”,  E33 58’ 31.51”, elevation 2285m
-- Ur, Iraq
-- I will also sometimes use the tiny map to click to areas along the Tigris and Euphrates.  These rivers are mentioned early in Genesis.
- I was a bit concerned with the accuracy of the location of solar system objects. The Stellarium manual Appendix F contains information about the accuracy.  I did load in NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Ephe-me-ris files DE441 and DE431 files.  https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/orbits.html
- The default Stellarium locations of the moon and our solar system are a close enough estimate for the purpose of this calendar system.  I did test loading in DE441 and DE431 indexes into Stellarium in order to compare locations of sun moon and planets around year -4500.  The Stellarium’s default locations are good enough for the purpose of this map without having to load additional Ephemeris files.
