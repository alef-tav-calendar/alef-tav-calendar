## Stellarium Configuration for Alef-Tav Calendar Videos
This is a list of the Stellarium Software settings that I used in the videos.

- Install Stellarium from https://stellarium.org/
- Load in Aleph Bet constellation maps as a sky-culture. Available to download on this GitHub site.
- Replace the default **milkyway.png** with a higher resolution version to see more details. Download it from this GitHub site in stellarium/milkyway.png.
-- I also use higher resolution photos found through a Google image search outside of Stellarium.
- **View Options** => **Sky** tab: Reduce the brightness of the stars by adjusting the Absolute scale down between 0.6 and 0.4. We only want to work with the brightest stars.
- **View Options** => **Sky** tab: Later, you may want to increase the Milky Way Brightness.
- **View Options** => **Markings** tab: Useful markings include:
-- Equinoxes (of date)
-- Solstices (of date)
-- Ecliptic (of date)
- **View Options** => **Starlore** tab: As the edges of the letters overlap, it is useful to have two charts for even and odd letters. Place the Starlore dialogue off to the far right of the screen for easier toggling between charts.
Load in some landscapes from the area of Mount Ararat.
- The view and angle of the stars change with your location on Earth. I’ll use the following locations:
-- Jerusalem (built-in)
-- Egypt (built-in)
-- Yerevan, Western Asia (built-in) - near Mount Ararat.
-- Mt Sinai (added) N28 32’ 21.90”, E33 58’ 31.51”, elevation 2285m
-- Ur, Iraq
-- I will also sometimes use the tiny map to click on areas along the Tigris and Euphrates. These rivers are mentioned early in Genesis.
- I was a bit concerned about the accuracy of the location of solar system objects. The Stellarium manual Appendix F contains information about the accuracy. I did load in NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ephemeris files DE441 and DE431 files from https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/orbits.html.
- The default Stellarium locations of the moon and our solar system are close enough estimates for the purpose of this calendar system. I did test loading in DE441 and DE431 indexes into Stellarium to compare the locations of the sun, moon, and planets around the year -4500. The Stellarium default locations are adequate for this map without additional Ephemeris files.
