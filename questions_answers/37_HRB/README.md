Your traductions are weird : Harb doesn't mean Dried, it could mean "hot", still a superficial approach, because HRB has a deeper meaning, related to conflict, friction, abrasion. Jeff Benner took from qabbalists and their mistakes and linguistic errors, and he didn't study arabic, because his christian background and their compulsive repulsion for Islam. A proof the jews and Benner have wrong in their studies : the K is the archetyp of the Similarity.

Thank you for your comment. I appreciate the feedback. I agree that the word (חרב) has multiple definitions.

In the context of Genesis 8:13, (חרב) has the sense of "dry" and doesn't make sense if translated as "conflict, friction, abrasion." The verse describes the waters being "dried" up from the earth, which aligns with the concept of dryness.

According to the Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon, the same 3-letter word has the following definitions:
I) be dry, drought
II) be waste, desolate
III) attack, smite down, (sword)

While the BDB lexicon shows Arabic words for definitions (II) and (III), it doesn't include an Arabic definition for (I), which is related to dryness. I don't read Arabic, so I would be curious how Genesis 8:13 reads in Arabic.

Google Translate also provides similar translations under (חרב).

Regarding Jeff Benner, I reference his work because it aligns with the BDB lexicon in grouping words with similar meanings.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to address the latter part of your comment about Qabbalists, Arabic, Christian, and Islam as they are outside the scope of this research project. These topics emerge thousands of years after the Noah Narrative.
