Your traductions are weird : Harb doesn't mean Dried, it could mean "hot", still a superficial approach, because HRB has a deeper meaning, related to conflict, friction, abrasion. Jeff Benner took from qabbalists and their mistakes and linguistic errors, and he didn't study arabic, because his christian background and their compulsive repulsion for Islam. A proof the jews and Benner have wrong in their studies : the K is the archetyp of the Similarity.         

@AlefTavCalendar  Translation is a delicate subject, and diachrony (changing of meaning through time) another issue, when it's about God's words, isn't it ? Both are due to interpretations, so the one who interpretate. This is why I decide to know arabic when it's about the Qur'an , and now Hebrew about the Torah. I trust only the word, its morphosemantic : HRB there is etyma (archaic root) HR (see https://lexicon.quranic-research.net/data/06_H/057_Hr.html) and the B is the archetyp of the acces, the contact with someone or something. So HR is about of restriction, the H beeing the archetyp of the Membrane (so the meaning of Life) and the R is the Tension. HR is to be free from something, so the water in case of Dried or Thirty. Jeff is following mostly the qabbalist about the meaning of the letters, and I had never been able to discuss with him about the qabbalist errors. And for sur no, each structure of a word, each letter change the meaning, there is no synonymy in hebrew words or arabic ones. So HRB it's about independance, free from something, and added to the final B, it's about friction, so War in arabic, hot battle to gain independance. also, see genesis 14.21-22 the word חוֹמָ֔ה is related to dry, to warm, like the baked bricks, so the etyma HM which gave Kemite, the black people, one son of Noah..Letter meaning, etyma, root then morphology, then we have the semantical field of a semitic word.          

@AlefTavCalendar  Recently, I found an amazing hebrew site : SERAFIA https://www.sefaria.org/. In a way, it looks like your site. If you don't know, it will help you in your investigations. Above, I explain you how semantic is working in semitic languages See the link I gave you about etyma (archaic root) HR it's حر in arabic and חר in hebrew (see here https://lexicon.quranic-research.net/data/06_H/058_Hrb.html). I said that the semantical field of חרב it's despoil, be freed of something, and חר it's to act to protect independance, a privacy, example Haram, (illicite, forbidden in arabic) it is something protected from any intrusion. And יָבֵשׁ its meaning is not ambigus, the final S expresses a waste, an escape, a lost. So about qabbalist works and Jeff Benner, they are not linguists, but playing misticism, a magic, mistery, esoterism. You may know about Guematria, rabbies playing lotery with numbers, a foolish tricks confusing the meaning of anciant hebrew.

Thank you for your comment. I appreciate the feedback. I agree that the word (חרב) has multiple definitions.

In the context of Genesis 8:13, (חרב) has the sense of "dry" and doesn't make sense if translated as "conflict, friction, abrasion." The verse describes the waters being "dried" up from the earth, which aligns with the concept of dryness.

According to the Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon, the same 3-letter word has the following definitions:
I) be dry, drought
II) be waste, desolate
III) attack, smite down, (sword)

While the BDB lexicon shows Arabic words for definitions (II) and (III), it doesn't include an Arabic definition for (I), which is related to dryness. I don't read Arabic, so I would be curious how Genesis 8:13 reads in Arabic.

Google Translate also provides similar translations under (חרב).

Regarding Jeff Benner, I reference his work because it aligns with the BDB lexicon in grouping words with similar meanings.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to address the latter part of your comment about Qabbalists, Arabic, Christian, and Islam as they are outside the scope of this research project. These topics emerge thousands of years after the Noah Narrative.

Thank you for expanding on your first comment above. Your expanded explanation is starting to make more sense. If I understand correctly, in Arabic, the root (חרב) does not relate to "dry," whereas in Hebrew, (חרב) is used for “dried” and “dry” in Genesis 8:13.

I'm guessing that in Arabic, verse 13 uses a different Arabic family of words to express "dry"? Using (חרב) to express "dry" makes no sense in Arabic? The Hebrew of verse 13 sounds foreign and strange in Arabic thought? 

A different word is used in verses 7 and 14 for "dry" in Hebrew: (יָבֵשׁ).

Are you able to comment on how Arabic expresses "dry" in the context of verses 13, 14, and 7?

I'd like to update the git-hub page to accurately convey both your comment and my understanding of it.  Maybe even a short summary of how Arabic and Hebrew would differ in understanding of "dry" in context of verse 13.
