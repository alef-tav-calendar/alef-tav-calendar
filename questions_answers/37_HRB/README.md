This is a discussion around Genesis 8:13 and how word (חרב) "dry" is understood differently in two langagues: Arabic & Hebrew. This discussion required some reference images be uploaded to github.

@victoremman4639  wrote several times here is an attempt to summarize:

There is 3 layers of understanding a semitic word:
- the root HRB
- the etyma HR
- the letter alone H or R or B. 

Here, I specify that it is the same word in Hebrew and Arabic, same semantic field:
- in Hebrew, the term can mean a land deprived of something (water or other),
- in Arabic it is to deprive something or someone of property or life (war). 

HR is حر in Arabic and חר in Hebrew.  HR is essentially about privacy.

(In regard to texts that are sacred to cultures):
- Arabic is the best language to understand the Qur'an
- Hebrew is the best language to understand to Torah

The semantical field of חרב it's despoil, be freed of something, and חר it's to act to protect independance, a privacy, example Haram, (illicite, forbidden in arabic) it is something protected from any intrusion. And יָבֵשׁ its meaning is not ambigus, the final S expresses a waste, an escape, a lost. 

From an Arabic linquistic perspective, @victoremman4639 does not agree with the logic of: Qabbalist, Jeff Benner, and Guematria.

Refrence:
- HRB there is etyma (archaic root) (see https://lexicon.quranic-research.net/data/06_H/057_Hr.html)
- Hebrew Tanakh and various other writings from their history: https://www.sefaria.org/.


My replies summarized:

I have not studied Arabic, so my understanding of that language it's culture is limited.  I agree that the word (חרב) has multiple definitions in Hebrew.

According to the Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon, the same 3-letter word has the following definitions:
I) be dry, drought
II) be waste, desolate
III) attack, smite down, (sword)

See [hrb_bdb.jpg](hrb_bdb.jpg)

While the BDB lexicon shows Arabic words for definitions (II) and (III), it doesn't include an Arabic definition for (I), which is related to dryness. As in Arabic they don't use the same root word to express "dry".

In the context of [Genesis 8:13](gen8.13.png), (חרב) has the sense of "dry" and using an Arabic sense of that root word "conflict, friction, abrasion" can cause difficulties.

Similar to BDB lexicon - Google Translate also provides similar translations under (חרב) see [hrb_google_translate.png](hrb_google_translate.png).

Regarding Jeff Benner, I reference his work because it aligns with the BDB lexicon in grouping words with similar meanings.  I try my best to use multiple references in this research.

Unfortunately, the broad topics of Qabbalists, Guematria, Arabic, Christian, and Islam are currently outside the scope of this research project. These topics emerge thousands of years after the Noah Narrative.

Thank you.
