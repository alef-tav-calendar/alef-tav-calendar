### Alef-Tav Calendar
The Alef-Tav Calendar repository.

This is part of an ancient Astronomical Chronology puzzle.

This is a preliminary research project.  An investigation into if the Paleo Hebrew alphabet is part of a calendar system used to map the passage of time.

See the [Alef-Tav Calendar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbRaSh0207d5oxxRnekgN2GdKQNFtZT2z) video series for details. Psalm 19 & 119


### Research Summary

* The calendar system in the Noah narrative precisely follows the night sky over the course of one year.  Key astronomical events corresponding to Genesis 7–8 include:

* The birth dates in Genesis 5 track earth's axial precession. [Chapter 54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v72Zm76FQBY) is summarized in this short video:

* The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet was part of an ancient calendar system used to track time.
  - Apparent recognizable shapes in the Milky Way were used for naming conventions. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet letter meanings are describing apparent shapes in the Milky Way.
  - When the Milky Way is above or below the ecliptic path, the horizon served as a cross reference transversal line between the Milky Way and the ecliptic.  
  - The apparent recognizable shapes were used to track the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets on the ecliptic path.
  - See [Chapter 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8pbYoZQ3v0) 
* The 22 constellation regions of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet correspond to the 22 apparent retrograde motions of Mercury over a 7-year period. See [Chapter 39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWHMoqggJig).
