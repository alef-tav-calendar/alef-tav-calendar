### Alef-Tav Calendar

This repository explores astro-chronology: a potential connection between the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet and a calendar system used to track the passage of time. Please use discretion when investigating this calendar system.

As part of an ongoing preliminary research project, we investigate how the Alef-Tav letters may have been historically used as constellation time markers. This study aims to uncover whether these ancient characters were integrated into a sophisticated timekeeping system.

Much of this preliminary research is explored in detail through the [Alef-Tav Calendar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbRaSh0207d5oxxRnekgN2GdKQNFtZT2z) video series.

### Research Summary

* The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet was part of an ancient calendar system used to track time.
  - Apparent recognizable shapes in the Milky Way were used for naming conventions. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet letter meanings are describing 22 apparent shapes in the Milky Way.
  - When the Milky Way is above or below the ecliptic path, the horizon is used as a transversal line between the Milky Way and the ecliptic.  
  - The apparent recognizable shapes were used to track the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets on the ecliptic path.
  - See [Chapter 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8pbYoZQ3v0). 
* The 22 constellation regions correspond to the 22 apparent retrograde motions of Mercury over a 7-year period. These 22 regions are named as per Paleo-Hebrew Alphabet letter meanings. See [Chapter 39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWHMoqggJig).
* Testing the Alef-Tav Calendar system with the Noah narrative in Genesis revealed that the narrative precisely follows the night sky over the course of one year.  Key astronomical events corresponding to Genesis 7–8 include:

  - Oct 14, -2726 (7:4,6): Fall equinox
  - Oct 21, -2726 (7:10-11): Quintuple planetary conjunction (Sun and Mercury in the letter Mem/water)
  - Nov 30, -2726 (7:12,17): Mercury retrograde in Ayin
  - Mar 20, -2725 (7:24, 8:3-4): Mercury retrograde in Alef
  - May 31, -2725 (8:5): Venus begins retrograde motion
  - July 10, -2725 (8:6-9): Venus ends retrograde motion
  - July 17, -2725 (8:10): Summer solstice (longest day)
  - July 24, -2725 (8:12): Mercury retrograde
  - Aug 27, -2725 (8:13): Noah’s birthdate (first month, head of the year)
  - Oct 21, -2725 (8:14): Completion of a full 365-day solar year via lunar month count
  - The Genesis dating system is far suprior and is much more advanced than the Mesopotamian story: Epic of Gilgamesh.
* The birth dates in Genesis 5 track earth's axial precession. [Chapter 54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v72Zm76FQBY) is summarized in this short video:
