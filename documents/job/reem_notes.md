Here is some more research on the Reem from someone who wishes to remain anonymous.


In early translations that used the Septuagint as a source, the last animal listed in verse 21 is named the “unicorn,” which has resulted in no small amount of derision from critics.

However, based on similarities in related languages, most biblical scholars today translate re’em as “wild oxen,” which is very likely the now-extinct aurochs once present and hunted in the ANE. This connection was first noticed by Henry Rawlinson, an English officer stationed in Bagdad in the early 19th century who translated some Mesopotamian cuneiform text. He encountered the word rimu, an Akkadian cognate to re’em, and made the connection to the aurochs.

The aurochs or urus (Bos primigenius), an extinct species of cattle that once ranged through the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, India, and Asia. It was about a third larger than domestic cattle, and stood over six feet tall at the shoulder. Apparently, this animal was murderously aggressive.

The ancient evidence that supports the idea that re’em was the aurochs and that its range once included the Middle East includes the following:

 - Pharaoh Ramses II (1197-1165 BCE) was pictured in reliefs hunting the aurochs in Egypt

 - The Assyrian king Senacherib (704-681 BCE) was pictured in reliefs hunting the aurochs in North Mesopotamia.

 - The Greek historian Herodotus (around 485-425 BCE) mentioned in Historiën, Book lV, chapter 183 the presence of cattle in Libya that grazed backwards due to their curved horns.

So, how did wild oxen become unicorns?

The aurochs was gradually hunted to extinction, disappearing from its original range—the last known aurochs died in the forest of Jaktorów, Poland in 1627. It is likely that the aurochs was extinct in Egypt hundreds of years before the time that the Septuagint was written. The Jewish scholars who translated the Septuagint were likely not familiar with the aurochs, so they substituted a contemporary grazing animal that was known for its ferocity and worthy of the warning in Job. These scholars chose what we now know as the Indian rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) based on the wildly exaggerated description from the Greek physician and historian Ctesias around 400 BCE in his monograph, On India.

Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) later wrote, “The unicorn is the fiercest animal, and it is said that it is impossible to capture one alive. It has the body of a horse, the head of a stag, the feet of an elephant, the tail of a boar, and a single, black horn three feet long in the middle of its forehead.”

So, the evidence shows that the range of the aurochs once included the ancient Near East, and that it gradually became extinct in the area well before the time that the Septuagint was being written.

However, a similarly large and ferocious animal that was known in the Greek-speaking world at the time was the Indian rhinoceros, which the writers of the Septuagint used as an equivalent to the re’em. In Greek, this animal was called monokeros, which in Latin is unicornis.

This is how nine unicorns charged into the Bible, and how “wild oxen” is a more accurate translation.

Note: Julius Caesar wrote about aurochs in Gallic War Chapter 6.28, "...those animals which are called uri. These are a little below the elephant in size, and of the appearance, color, and shape of a bull. Their strength and speed are extraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied. These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them. The young men harden themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves in this sort of hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them, having produced the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great praise. But not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. The size, shape, and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen. These they anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips with silver, and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments."

Around the turn of the twentieth century (i.e. 1900), the Akkadian cognate word rimu was discovered. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re%27em) credits Johann Ulrich Duerst for this discovery, while this article says it was Henry Rawlinson. In any case, the idea made an impact quickly as can be seen by, for example, the 1906 [Jewish Encyclopedia article](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14584-unicorn):

The allusions to the "re'em" as a wild, untamable animal of great strength and agility, with mighty horns (Job xxxix. 9-12; Ps. xxii. 21, xxix. 6; Num. xxiii. 22, xxiv. 8; Deut. xxxiii. 17; comp. Ps. xcii. 11), best fit the aurochs (Bos primigenius). This view is supported by the Assyrian "rimu," which is often used as a metaphor of strength, and is depicted as a powerful, fierce, wild, or mountain bull with large horns.

The linguistic history is laid out in detail in [The Unicorn in the Old Testament](http://www.jstor.org/stable/529172) 1939 by Allen H. Godbey

As an aside, [this article](http://www.ybp.com/acad/picks/PPicksJan10.htm) is a fascinating read on the history of the understanding of the passages, rhinoceros trade, and various other things.

The decisive factor came with the deciphering of the cuneiform inscriptions... reaching back four thousand years earlier than any Hebrew text that we have, the texts give the word rimu repeatedly... It is a gigantic wild ox. The cuneiform ideogram confines him to the mountains.

Partially correct

“The unicorn mistranslation derives from the Septuagint. The aurochs, it seems, was typically depicted in Assyrian art from a profile view with gives it the appearance of having one horn. [This image](http://web.archive.org/web/20120726011318/http:/www.christiansofiraq.com/Rimu.jpg) may show the animal in question. Perhaps lacking a specific word for the aurochs, but being aware of what it looked like, the translators described in as the monkeros ("one-horned") because of the one horn. (The animals was likely locally extinct by then; it went extinct globally in the 16th century.) As Greeks learned of the rhinoceros this word adopted to describe it (or maybe the word was first used for the rhino and adapted to translate re'em since both animals essential feature was having one horn), and eventually changed to rhinokeros.”
